/*
    Channel supports any number of senders and receivers, and every value that is sent to a channel is received only once.
    Channel is an interface that implements two other interfaces:
        SendChannel, which is used to send elements (adding elements) and to close the channel;
        ReceiveChannel, which receives (or takes)the elements.
    When we try to receive and there are no elements in the channel, the coroutine is suspended until the element is available.
    On the other hand, send will be suspended when the channel reaches its capacity.

    If you need to send or receive from a non-suspending function, you can use trySend and tryReceive. Both operations are immediate and
    return ChannelResult, which contains information about the success or failure of the operation, as well as its result. Use trySend and
    tryReceive only for channels with limited capacity because they will not work for the rendezvous channel.

    A channel might have any number of senders and receivers. However, the most common situation is when there is one
    coroutine on both sides of the channel.

    Such an implementation is far from perfect. First, the receiver needs to know how
    many elements will be sent; however, this is rarely the case, so we would prefer
    to listen for as long as the sender is willing to send. To receive elements on the
    channel until it is closed, we could use a for-loop or consumeEach function

    The common problem with this way of sending elements is that it is easy to forget
    to close the channel, especially in the case of exceptions. If one coroutine stops

    much more convenient to use the produce function, which is a coroutine builder
    that returns ReceiveChannel.

    The produce function closes the channel whenever the builder coroutine ends in

    Channels are useful when different coroutines need to communicate with each
    other. They guarantee no conflicts (i.e., no problem with the shared state) and

    on one side, and we want to process them on the other side. Channels are used
    to separate producers and consumers of data.

/*
    Channel is a powerful inter-coroutine communication primitive. It supports any
    number of senders and receivers, and every value that is sent to a channel is
    received once.We often create a channel using the produce builder, and observe a
    channel using for-loop. Channels can be used to set up a pipelinewherewe control
    the number of coroutines working on some tasks. Nowadays, we most often use
    channels in connection with Flow, which will be presented later in the book.

    Coroutines provide the select function, which lets us await the result of the
    first coroutine that completes. It also offers the possibility of sending to the first
    channel that has space in the buffer or receiving from the first channel that has
    an available element. This lets us make races between coroutines or join results
    from multiple sources. Letâ€™s see it in practice.
 */

/*
    Letâ€™s say that we want to request data from multiple sources, but weâ€™re only
    interested in the fastest response. The easiest way to achieve this is to start these
    requests in async processes; then, use the select function as an expression, and
    await different values inside it. Inside select, we can call onAwait on Deferred
    value, which specifies a possible select expression result. Inside its lambda expression, you can transform
    the value. In the example below, we just return an
    async result, so the select expression will complete once the first async task is
    completed, then it will return its result.

    Notice that after the select expression, we call cancelChildren on coroutineContext to cancel all the coroutines
    that were started inside the select expression. This is important because without it, coroutineScope would not
    complete until all the coroutines started inside its scope are completed.

    The select function can also be used with channels. These are the main functions

    onReceive - selected when this channel has a value. It receives this value (like the receive method)

    onReceiveCatching - selected when this channel has a value or is closed. It receives ChannelResult, which either
    represents a value or signals that this channel is closed, and it uses this value as an argument for its lambda
    expression. When onReceiveCatching is selected, select returns the result of its lambda expression

    onSend - selected when this channel has space in the buffer. It sends a value
    to this channel (like the send method) and invokes its lambda expression
    with a reference to the channel. When onSend is selected, select returns Unit.
