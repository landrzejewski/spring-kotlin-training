/*
    A flow represents a lazy process that emits values. The Flow interface itself only
    allows the flowing elements to be collected, which means handling each element
    as it reaches the end of the flow (collect for Flow is like forEach for collections).

    Flow should be used for streams of data that need to use coroutines.

    The simplest way to create a flow is by using the flowOf function, where we just
    define what values this flow should have(similar to the listOf function for a list).

    At any point of flow building or processing, an exception might occur. Such an
    exception will flow down, closing each processing step on the way; however, it
    can be caught and managed. To do so, we can use the catch method. This listener
    receives the exception as an argument and allows you to perform recovering operations.

    The catch will only react to the exceptions thrown in the function defined
    upstream (you can imagine that the exception needs to be caught as it flows down).

/*
    Uncaught exceptions in a flow immediately cancel this flow, and collect
    rethrows this exception. This behavior is typical of suspending functions, and
    coroutineScope behaves the same way. Exceptions can be caught outside flow
    using the classic try-catch block.

    Notice that using catch does not protect us from an exception in the terminal
    operation (because catch cannot be placed after the last operation). So, if there
    is an exception in the collect, it wonâ€™t be caught, and an error will be thrown.

    Therefore, it is common practice to move the operation from collect to onEach
    and place it before the catch. This is specifically useful if we suspect that collect
    might raise an exception. If we move the operation from collect, we can be sure
    that catch will catch all exceptions.

/*
    An exception flows through a flow, closing each step one by one. These steps
    become inactive, so it is not possible to send messages after an exception, but each
    step gives you a reference to the previous ones, and this reference can be used
    to start this flow again. Based on this idea, Kotlin offers the retry and retryWhen

    stateIn is a function that transforms Flow<T> into StateFlow<T>. It can only be

    needs to always have a value; so, if you donâ€™t specify it, then you need to wait until
    the first value is calculated.
