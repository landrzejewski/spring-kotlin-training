    Starting coroutines is possible using:
        Asynchronous coroutine builders (launch and async), which start an asynchronous coroutine
        Blocking coroutine builders (runBlocking and runTest), which start a coroutine on the current thread and block it until the coroutine is done
        Coroutine scope functions, which create a synchronous coroutine (suspend the current coroutine until the new one is completed)
    If we call await on an already completed Deferred, then there is no suspending

    Structured Concurrency
    When a coroutine is started on a scope, it becomes a child of this scope.
    The parent-child relationship has a couple of important consequences:
        Children inherit context from their parent (but they can also overwrite it)
        A parent cannot complete until all its children have completed
        When the parent is cancelled, its child coroutines are cancelled too
        When a child completes with an exception, this exception is passed to the parent

    GlobalScope is literally an empty scope that configures nothing and builds no relationship with coroutines started
    on it, therefore it is considered bad practice to use it because it can easily break our relationships and
    it cannot be used to control coroutines started on it

    Coroutine scope functions are suspending functions that start a synchronous coroutine - a new coroutine but suspend the current
    one until the new one is completed. They behave a lot like runBlocking, but instead of blocking the thread they suspend the coroutine

    Coroutine scope functions are suspending functions that do not require a scope, while coroutine builders are
    regular functions that do require a scope

    In practice, coroutine scope functions are used to create a scope for asynchronous coroutines

    coroutineScope is the most basic coroutine scope function
    withContext behaves just like coroutineScope but can change the context of the coroutine
    supervisorScope behaves just like coroutineScope but ignores its childrenâ€™s exceptions
    withTimeout behaves just like coroutineScope but cancels the coroutine after a timeout

/*
    CoroutineContext is an interface that represents an element or a collection of elements and implements the Composite design pattern.
    It is an indexed set of element instances like Job, CoroutineName, CouroutineDispatcher, etc.

    So, CoroutineContext is just a way to hold and pass data. By default, the parent
    passes its context to the child, which is one of the effects of the parent-child
    relationship. We say that a child inherits its context from its parent.
    Each child might have a specific context defined in the argument. This context
    overrides the one from the parent.

    There is one special context called Job, which keeps the state of the current
    coroutine. It is the only context that is not inherited because each coroutine must
    have its own job.

    If you want to modify a context for a suspend function, you can use withContext,
    which behaves like coroutineScope but changes the context for the coroutine
    it creates. It is a suspending function, so it can be used in other suspending
    functions.

    suspend fun readSave() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val file = File("save.txt")
        file.readText()
    }

    withContext is often used to define a context that should be specific to a given
    operation. Remember that context is propagated automatically, so whatever is set
    in the parent coroutine will be available in the child coroutine.

    Kotlin Coroutines are not associated with concrete threads. A coroutine might
    start on one thread, get suspended, and then be resumed on another thread.
