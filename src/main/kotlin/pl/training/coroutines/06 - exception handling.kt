/*
    Suspending functions and synchronous coroutines, including coroutine scope functions and runBlocking,
    throw exceptions that end their body.

    Asynchronous coroutine builders (async and launch) propagate exceptions that end their body to their parents
    via the scope. An exception received this way is treated as if it occurred in the parent coroutine.

    An important consequence of this mechanism is that exceptions propagate from
    child to parent. Yes, if you have a process that starts a number of coroutines and
    one of them throws an exception, this will automatically lead to the cancellation
    of all the other coroutines.

    SupervisorJob is a special kind of job that ignores all exceptions in its children.
    SupervisorJob is generally used as part of a scope in which we start multiple
    coroutines (more about this in the Constructing coroutine scope chapter). Thanks
    to this, an exception in one coroutine will not cancel this scope and all its children.

/*
    The only simple way to start a coroutine with a SupervisorJob is to use
    supervisorScope. It is a coroutine scope function, so it behaves just like
    coroutineScope, but it uses a SupervisorJob instead of a regular Job. This
    way, exceptions from its children are ignored (they only print stacktrace).

    Beware that supervisorScope only ignores exceptions from its children. If an
    exception occurs in supervisorScope itself, it breaks this coroutine builder and
    the exception propagates to its parent. If an exception occurs in a child of a child,
    it propagates to the parent of this child, destroys it, and only then gets ignored.

    supervisorScope is often used when we need to start multiple independent processes and we donâ€™t want an
    exception in one of them to cancel the others.

    supervisorScope does not support changing context. If you need to both change
    context and use a SupervisorJob, you need to wrap supervisorScope with withContext.

    When we call await on Deferred, it should return the result of this coroutine

    enough to use supervisorScope: we also need to catch the exception when calling await.
