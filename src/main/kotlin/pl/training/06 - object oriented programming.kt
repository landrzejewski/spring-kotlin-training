    In Kotlin, we can define inner classes. They are static by default, which

    If you want your inner class to have a reference to its outer class, you need to use inner modifier.

    Data classes are primarily used to hold data. For each data class, the compiler automatically generates
    additional member functions:
        equals()/hashCode()
        toString() of the form "User(name=John, age=42)".
        componentN() functions corresponding to the properties in their order of declaration.
        copy() function
    To ensure consistency and meaningful behavior of the generated code, data classes have to fulfill the following requirements:
        the primary constructor must have at least one parameter
        all primary constructor parameters must be marked as `val` or `var`
        data classes can't be abstract, open, sealed, or inner
        inside the body, we should only keep redundant immutable properties, usually calculated from main properties

    Extension functions are defined like regular functions, but they additionally have an extra
    type (and dot) before the function name. Extension functions can be defined on types we don’t control.
    This gives us the power to extend external APIs with our own functions. When you define an extension function,
    you do not really add anything to a class. It is just syntactic sugar.
    We can define extension properties if they do not need a backing field and are defined by accessors.
    Extensions need to be imported separately. For this reason, they can be located in a different package.
    (we can have many extensions with the same name for the same type). Extensions are not virtual, meaning that
    they cannot be redefined in derived classes.

    Inline classes - a value class in Kotlin holds a single immutable value which can be inlined
    on compilation removing the wrapper type and using the underlying value itself.
    When we place the inline modifier before a function, its body will replace its usages (calls) during
    compilation.

    The simplest example is the print function from Kotlin stdlib. In JVM, it calls System.out.print.
    Since print is an inline function, all its usages during compilation are replaced with its body,
    so the print call is replaced with a System.out.print call.
