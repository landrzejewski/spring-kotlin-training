/*
    Packages are a way to group files together and avoid name conflicts. If we donâ€™t specify a package,
    the file belongs to the default package. The package membership declaration should be the first significant
    line of the source file. The package name does not have to correspond to the actual directory structure on disk,
    but it is a good practice.

    To use a function or class from another package, we need to import it. Imports are specified after the package
    declaration and before other elements.

    Default imports include: kotlin.*, kotlin.annotation.*, kotlin.collections.*, java.lang.

    The program is started by executing the main function, the input parameters are optional.
    Other examples of valid main function:

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        println("Hello World")
    }

    fun main(vararg args: String) {
        println("Hello World")

    suspend fun main() {
        println("Hello World")
