/*
    Read-only variables are declared using the `val` keyword. Variables whose state can change are declared using the
    `var` keyword. Kotlin is a statically typed language, and the type of a variable can be specified by the programmer
    or inferred by the compiler. In Kotlin, all values are considered objects (there are no primitive types).
    All basic types that represent numbers are a subtype of the Number type. Explicit type conversion is done using
    dedicated methods, e.g. toByte(), toShort() or toChar().

    Build-in types:

    Type	Size (bits)    Min value	Max value
    Byte	8	           -128	        127
    Short	16	           -32768	    32767
    Int	    32	           -2^31	    2^31-1    // default
    Long	64	           -2^63	    2^63-1

    Type	Size (bits)	   Min value	Max value
    UByte	8	           0	        255
    UShort	16	           0	        65535
    UInt	32	           0	        2^32-1
    ULong	64	           0	        2^64-1

    Type	Size (bits)	   Significant bits	     Exponent bits 	    Decimal digits
    Float	32	           24	                 8	                6-7
    Double	64	           53	                 11	                15-16             // default

    /*
        Kotlin offers a standard set of arithmetic operators, i.e. +, -, *, /, %. Dividing integers always returns
        an integer (the fractional part is discarded). The type of the returned result is promoted to the
        largest of the types used. It is possible to override standard operators.

        Kotlin also supports operations that modify a mutable variables:
            +=, where a += b is the equivalent of a = a + b
            -=, where a -= b is the equivalent of a = a - b
            *=, where a *= b is the equivalent of a = a * b
            /=, where a /= b is the equivalent of a = a / b
            %=, where a %= b is the equivalent of a = a % b
            post-incrementation and pre-incrementation ++, which increment variables value by 1
            post-decrementation and pre-decrementation --, which decrement variables value by 1

            xor - keeps only bits that have exactly one 1 in the same binary positions in both numbers

        it is not possible to check the exact type of an object (an exception may be when the type results
        from the context, e.g. function input arguments checked at compile time).
        Explicit casting can be performed using the `as` operator. If the cast is not possible, the operation will
        throw an exception.
